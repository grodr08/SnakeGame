# SnakeGame

Simple Snake game using Java as the programming language and swing as the GUI (Graphical User Interface). This game helped me understand how to work with grids and 2D arrays. How to use JFrame and JPanel to create an interactive and graphical pleasing game. How to extends classes and implementation of keybinds in the game.
